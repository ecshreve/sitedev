## About Me

I'm a seasoned software engineer who's just as comfortable wrangling databases as I am deploying applications to the cloud. With a career spanning over a decade, I've contributed to the tech community through robust code, innovative solutions, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.

From leading enhancements of enterprise products at Samara to pioneering customer support protocols, my journey has been fueled by curiosity and the constant drive to solve complex problems.

Outside of the code editor, I'm an avid art and music lover, with a personal commitment to universal education. In my homelab, I tinker with servers and network setups that would make Ada Lovelace proud, continually learning and growing in this fast-paced industry.
