## Details

### Registry

I'm currently running a private Docker registry on my homelab cluster. I use this registry to store images used by Nomad jobs, and images used by Coder templates. Initially I spun this up because I was iterating on the deploy process and was using a ton of bandwidth pulling images from Docker Hub. I've since found it useful to have a private registry for storing images that I've customized and don't need to publish.

### Devcontainers

Before I settled on Coder to manage my development environments, I spent quite awhile trying to find a comfortable workflow with [VS Code devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). There's still some `.devcontainer` files in scattered around my GitHub, but I'm not actively using them anymore.

### Packer

I've used Packer to build custom Docker images for use in my homelab. I've used it to build images for Nomad jobs, and images for Coder templates. Before Coder I also used Packer to build images to use with VS Code devcontainers. Why use Packer? I like to try things out and I was already using other Hashicorp tools, so it seemed like a good fit. Definitely worth the exploration, but I'm not actively using it anymore.[^packer-docs]

### Dockerfiles

Mainly used to build images to use with Coder templates and VS Code devcontainers. 

Also used to containerize some of my personal projects.

### Docker Compose

- docker-compose
