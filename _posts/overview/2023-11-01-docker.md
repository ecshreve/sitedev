Docker is another core piece of my lab setup. I use it to containerize services and applications that I run in my lab. I also use it to build and deploy custom images for my Nomad cluster.

## Details

- containerize services and applications
- build with dockerfiles
- build images with Packer
- deploy images with docker-compose
- deploy images with Nomad
- deploy images as Coder templates

## Reference

> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
