Orchestrate deploying services and tasks by executing nomad job specs. Most of
the services I've deployed are Docker workloads, though I do have one cron job
running as a Nomad batch job as well.[^nomad-docs]

## Summary

I use a Golang package I wrote and still tinker with to generate job specs from a
type definition, and then deploy them with a Taskfile target.

Previously managed deploying and managing the cluster with a combination of terraform, shell scripts, levant templating, bespoke code generation, Makefiles, and a Gitlab CI Pipeline on a locally hosted Gitlab instance. Things are much smoother now that everything is in one place (more or less).

## Reference

>Nomad is a highly available, distributed, data-center aware cluster and application scheduler designed to support the modern datacenter with support for long-running services, batch jobs, and much more.
