I use [Coder](https://coder.com) to have a web-based IDE for my development work.

Base images maintained in public docker repo, based on Dockerfiles found throughout
the Coder documentation and related projects.

At this time the `coderall-tmpl` is the Coder template I use for new workspaces. It's
based on the `ecshreve/coderall:eric` image. Which yieds a Ubuntu 22.04 based workspace
with varioud development tools and settings pre-configured.
