The "slomad" package is a key component of my lab setup. It provides a minimal interface to the Nomad API, facilitating the deployment of Nomad jobs. This package is specifically designed for use in a home lab environment, aligning with the overall objective of the slomad project to efficiently manage and deploy services within a personal lab setup. The focus is on simplicity and direct interaction with the Nomad API.
