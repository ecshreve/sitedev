The `slomad` package is a key component of my lab setup. It provides a minimal interface to the Nomad API, facilitating the planning and deployment of Nomad jobs. This package is specifically designed for use in my lab environment, though the general approach is applicable to any Nomad cluster. The focus is on simplicity and ease of use.
