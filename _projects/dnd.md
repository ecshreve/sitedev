# Dungeons and Dragons

I help maintain an open source project that provides REST API and GraphQL access to D&D 5th Edition SRD database. The project is live at [dnd5eapi.co](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/), and the code lives in this [repository](https://github.com/5e-bits/5e-srd-api).

Over the years I've made various improvements to the open source project, supported new users in our Discord server, and used the data in the underlying database to build a few projects of my own.
