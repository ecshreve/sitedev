# sitedev

Welcome to the sitedev repository! This project hosts the source code behind my personal website, built using Jekyllâ€”a static site generator. The site focuses on software development, technology, and various other topics that interest me. Designed with a modern, responsive layout using the Minima theme, the website features custom styling and several functionalities including dynamic tag pages, dynamic table of contents, and a custom "back to top" button.

Recently, I migrated the hosting of this site from **GitHub Pages** to **Cloudflare Pages**, simplifying the overall hosting and deployment of the site. 

The site structure includes key sections such as an 'About' page, a 'Blog' page, and a 'Tags' page for seamless content exploration. The project features robust development and deployment workflows facilitated by Jekyll and GitHub Actions, ensuring smooth and efficient updates. Various tools and languages are spotlighted throughout, supported by custom data files and comprehensive templates that make managing and expanding content straightforward.
