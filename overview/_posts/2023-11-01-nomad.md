{{ site.data.tools.nomad.brief }}

## Current Setup

- single node cluster, running on a VM in my homelab
- service discovery via Consul
- slomad for deploying jobs

## Previous Setup

Previously managed deploying to the cluster with a combination of Terraform, shell scripts, levant templating, custom code generation, Makefiles, Taskfiles, Jenkins, and a Gitlab CI Pipeline on a locally hosted Gitlab instance. Things are much smoother now that everything is in one place (more or less).
